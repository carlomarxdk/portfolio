One of the most fascinating aspects of the [life2vec project](https://life2vec.dk) was discovering how naturally human lives map onto sequences — much like sentences in natural language.

## The Language of Life

When you think about it, a human life is essentially a sequence of events:
- Born in a specific place
- Started school at age 6
- Graduated with a degree in Computer Science
- Got a job at a research institution
- And so on...

Just as words in a sentence carry meaning through their order and context, life events gain significance from their timing and surrounding circumstances.

## What We Learned

Using transformer models on life event sequences, we found that:

1. **Context matters immensely**: The same event (like changing jobs) means very different things depending on what came before and after
2. **Patterns emerge**: Certain sequences of events are strongly predictive of future outcomes
3. **Individual lives are unique**: Despite patterns, each trajectory has its own signature

## Looking Forward

This work opens up interesting questions about personalization, intervention, and the ethics of prediction. How do we use these insights responsibly? When is prediction helpful, and when does it become constraining?

More thoughts on this to come...
