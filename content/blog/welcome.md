I'm excited to start this blog as a space to share thoughts, reflections, and ideas that don't quite fit into academic papers but are worth discussing.

## Why Blog?

Academic research often follows a rigid structure, which is great for scientific communication but leaves little room for the messy, iterative process of discovery. Here, I want to explore:

- **Work in progress**: Ideas I'm currently exploring
- **Technical notes**: Solutions to problems I've encountered
- **Reflections**: Thoughts on research, technology, and science
- **Book recommendations**: What I'm reading and why

## What to Expect

I'll try to post regularly about topics at the intersection of network science, machine learning, and computational social science. Some posts will be technical deep-dives, others will be more philosophical musings.

Stay tuned!
