### Boston 
Well, it is finally sunny and warm-ish in Boston, so I am excited to restart my sand volleyball practice.
On the professional side, I'm wrapping up a project on *veracity tracking in LLMs* and slowly picking up some paused threads:
1. Foundation models for predicting gene mutations
2. Epistemic stability in LLMs

And planning some hiking trips for the late summer: Grand Canyon, maybe? 

### Books
Honestly, I couldn’t get myself to finish a book in the past six months. 
Every time I picked one up, it felt like too much — maybe because of all the heavy work-related reading.
But [On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10569.On_Writing) by *Stephen King* is slowly pulling me out of that weird slump.

The list of cool books (from 2024), and *recommend* to read (btw, my [GoodReads Profile](https://www.goodreads.com/converge)):
1. [Stolen Focus: Why You Can't Pay Attention](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57472384-stolen-focus) by *Johann Hari*,
2. [The MANIAC](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/75665931) by *Benjamín Labatut*,
3. [Homage to Catalonia](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9646.Homage_to_Catalonia) by *George Orwell*

Any book recommendations?
