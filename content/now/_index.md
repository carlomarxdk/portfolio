Last on updated on *1st November 2024*, while in *Cambridge (MA), USA*.


### Boston 
I started my Postdoc position in [RADLAB](https://eliassi.org/) (Network Science Institute, Northeastern University) not so long time ago: 
* Currently, working on the follow up stuff to *life2vec* project (soon to come),
* Looking into how LLMs react to truthfull and malicious inputs, focusing on the embeddings ofc 
* Writing couple of articles on LLMs in social science (should I post them on medium.com?)

### Travel Plans
Going to be in Europe (Latvia) from 5th November till 19th November (and maybe sometime in February, I'll drop by Finland and Denmark).

### Books
