### Work and Stuff
Slowly getting back into the work flow...might be slow while replying on the emails.

As of Jan'24, I am a Research Assistant @ DTU (Social Complexity Lab). I am working on some follow up stuff to the [life2vec](https://www.life2vec.dk) paper, that includes:
1. Different data modalities
2. Social environments
3. Trying to clean up [life2vec github](https://github.com/SocialComplexityLab/life2vec).

Plus, I am focusing on my *dream* project connected to the National Library Use Data, aka how books change our life trajectories?

We can always chat more about the potential ideas.

### Books
I started this year with too many of them:
1. [Stolen Focus: Why You Can't Pay Attention](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57472384-stolen-focus) by *Johann Hari*
2. [Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199302548-tomorrow-and-tomorrow-and-tomorrow) by *Gabrielle Zevin*
3. [The Song of Achilles](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20634739-the-song-of-achilles) by *Madeline Miller*

### Other stuff
Getting ready to walk the Portuguese Way (from Porto) to Camino de Santiago (in May). Any tips?

### Postdoc
Exploring postdoc opportunities in the US/Canada (preferably East coast).
