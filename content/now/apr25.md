Last on updated on _1st November 2024_, while in _Cambridge (MA), USA_.

### Boston

I started my Postdoc position in [RADLAB](https://eliassi.org/) (Network Science Institute, Northeastern University) not so long time ago:

- Currently, working on the follow up stuff to _life2vec_ project (soon to come),
- Looking into how LLMs react to truthfull and malicious inputs, focusing on the embeddings ofc
- Writing couple of articles on LLMs in social science (should I post them on medium.com?)

### Travel Plans

Going to be in Europe (Latvia) from 5th November till 19th November (and maybe sometime in February, I'll drop by Finland and Denmark).

### Books

The list of cool books, I have read this year and _recommend_ to read (btw, my [GoodReads Profile](https://www.goodreads.com/converge)):
