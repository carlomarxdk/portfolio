### Closing work stuff

As of Jan'24, I am a Research Assistant @ DTU (Social Complexity Lab). I am working on some follow up stuff to the [life2vec](https://www.life2vec.dk) paper, that includes a simpler implementation of the workflow: [carlomarxdk/life2vec-light](https://github.com/carlomarxdk/life2vec-light).

Working with the Library Transaction dataset (book embeddings?)...

### Things to come

As of May'24, I am starting as a Postroctoral Associate Researcher in [RADLAB](https://eliassi.org/) (Network Science Institute, Northeastern University). I am going to work on the topics including _Just Machine Learning_ and _Trustworthy Network Science_.

Hence, I am also looking for a **long-term accomodation (or a room) in Boston** (starting from apprx. May 1st) in areas such as Allstone, Brookline, Fenway, North/South End, South Boston, Cambridge, Summerville (just to name a few). Drop me a message if you know something :)
